    <h2 style="color: blueviolet; font-size: 40px;">Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and is referred to as the “Red planet”. It gets the latter name because of <br>
        the presence of iron oxide on the surface of Mars, which gives it a reddish appearance. The largest volcano is <br>
        Olympus Mons and the highest mountain is Valles Marineris. The radius of Mars is 2,106 miles and is the <br>
        seventh-largest planet in our solar system.</p>
